## Errors

### Reverting all migrations

I tried to revert all migrations near the beginning and ran into this error:

![Reverting all migrations](media/readme-images/errors/revert_migrations.png)

I was able to solve it
with [Instructions found on Stack Overlflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50346326/programmingerror-relation-django-session-does-not-exist)
and running migrations again when I had made changes.

### Internal Server Error 500

I wasn’t getting an error when running locally, and it built fine on Heroku. There were no errors in the console on the
on Heroku. All I was getting as “Internal Server Error 500” (see image below). So I created a new branch from the last
commit and hosted that instead. That actually worked when built in Heroku so from that I knew it was something in the
last commit that was causing the error. After comparing the code to the tutorial I realized I wasn’t missing anything.
So after thinking further I thought it might be something that my local environment had that my Heroku one didn’t. Turns
out I hadn’t added stripe to requirements.txt

![Internal Server Error 500](media/readme-images/errors/internal_server_error_500.png)

### Custom Widget Template does not exist

After checking the paths were all correct I went searching online for a solution. I found
[this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45844032/django-templatedoesnotexist-in-case-of-a-custom-widget)
on Stack Overflow by user3763125.

![Custom Widget Template does not exist](media/readme-images/errors/internal_server_error_500.png)

### Page Not Found

This was an interesting one. I realized the path I want the app to take wasn't in the list of urls in the below image.
This led me to guess moving my url up in the list would help it be found first and it worked.

#### Lighthouse Testing

- Lighthouse was used to check perfomance and accessiblitiy. Performance surfers from initial server response time being
  on render.
  ![](media/readme-images/testing/lighthouse.png)

#### Security

- All SECRET access keys are stored safely in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database.
- Django’s setting DEBUG was set to False after development for deployment to prevent access to error screens revealing
  code or database entries.
- Django allauth was used to set up user registration and Django’s LoginRequiredMixin and UserPassesTestMixin were used
  to ensure only signed-in users and authors can edit and delete their product reviews.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site to prevent valid requests to the
  backend server from being created for malicious purposes.

## Deployment

**Josie Anes Patisserie** was developed using the **PyCharm IDE**, and using **Git** and **GitHub** for version control.
It is hosted on **Heroku** and all media files are hosted in **Cloudinary**.

Before deploying the application, install the following:

- Python 3
- PIP
- Git
- Heroku CLI

### Local Deployment

To deploy josie-annes-patisserie locally, take the following steps:

1. From the applications' [repository](https://github.com/sean-meade/josie-annes-patisserie), click the *code* button
   and download the zip file.

   Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your command prompt:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/sean-meade/josie-annes-patisserie
```

2. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's required modules with the following command:

```terminal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create the following environmental variables on your machine:

```
DATABASE_URL = YOUR_DATABASE_URL
SECRET_KEY = YOUR_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
CLOUDINARY_URL = YOUR_CLOUDINARY_KEY
DEBUG = True (False for production)
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = YOUR_STRIPE_WH_SECRET

```

4. In your IDE terminal, migrate the models to create the database using the following commands:

```terminal
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser to access the admin panel using the following command:

```terminal
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Then follow the instructions to create the superuser.

6. After you login to the admin panel, you can add data to be displayed in your app. Refer
   to [database modeling](#database-modelling).


7. To initiate the application, type the command `python manage.py runserver` in your terminal. The application is now
   available in your browser at the address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Deployment to Heroku

To deploy the app to Heroku, use the following steps:

3. Clone the repository like above.
4. Push these newly created files to your repository master.
5. Login to Heroku and create a new app.
6. In Heroku dashboard of the new app, click **deploy**, then **deployment** method and select **GitHub** to connect
   your app to your github repository for automatic deployment.
7. In Heroku Resources tab, navigate to **Add-Ons** section and search for **Heroku Postgres**. I recommend you choose
   hobby level for this application. You should also search for **Cloudinary - Image and Video Management** to ensure
   your media files load to Cloudinary.
8. In settings tab, navigate to **Reveal Config Vars** and add the following variables:

| **KEY**           | **VALUE**               |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| CLOUDINARY_URL    | YOUR_CLOUDINARY_URL     |
| DATABASE_URL      | YOUR_DATABASE_URL       |
| DEBUG_BOOL        | YOUR_DEBUG_BOOL         |
| SECRET_KEY        | YOUR_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET  | YOUR_STRIPE_WH_SECRET  |

9. In settings.py in your IDE, temporarily comment out the database and use below code instead (make sure you do not
   commit!):

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse('POSTGRESS URL')
}
```

10. In terminal, migrate the models to create the Postgress database using the following commands:

```terminal
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

11. Create a superuser to access the admin panel using the following command:

```terminal
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Then follow the instructions to create the superuser.

12. After you login to the admin panel, you can add data to be displayed in your app if required.

13. Remove the temporary database from settings.py and uncomment the original code, then push the code to origin.
14. Back to in **Heroku dashboad**, deploy the application.
15. To view the site, click on **View App**.
